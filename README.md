# WordPress Theme for pregnancy test products

This is a custom WordPress theme for a laboratory company that sells pregnancy test products made with Foundation Framework for front-end development.

I also use Grunt to concatenate and minify the Js files.

## Tools
  * [Fontello](http://fontello.com/): Use icon fonts instead of fontawesome.io to reduce file size
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) Concatenate and minify Js files to reduce server calls. Compile Sass and livereload.

## Notes
  * Deregister jQuery and replace it with (jQuery CDN)[https://code.jquery.com/]
  * Created Custom Post Types for patients inquiries
  * Create a Post from a Form Submission specifically for customer questions
