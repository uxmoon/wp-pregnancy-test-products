# WordPress Theme for pregnancy test products

This is a custom WordPress theme for a laboratory company that sells pregnancy test products made with Foundation Framework for front-end development.

I also use Grunt to concatenate and minify the Js files.

## Changelog

  * [Fontello](http://fontello.com/): Use icon fonts instead of fontawesome.io to reduce file size
  * Concatenate and minify Js files to reduce server calls
  * Use CDN for jQuery and jQuery UI Files
